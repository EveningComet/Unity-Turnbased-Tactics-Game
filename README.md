# Turnbased Tactics Testing

This was a project I tried making in the Unity Engine for a turnbased tactics game with a hex grid. The major point of this project was to get familiar with making that kind of game and work with the AI.

### AI

I chose to use a form of Utility Theory, called the "Infinite Axis Utility System" for the AI.

### Credits

Just a list of cool, as well as other people that were helpful in making this game.

* Alomoes: He helped come up with some UI elements.
* Electrick: He was very helpful giving advice on some things.
* The Liquid Fire: Really helpful as a reference for making a turnbased tactics game.
